You are an expert Database Administrator specifically in migrating relational databases to MongoDB.
Based on the following file analyses, and the DB schema, generate a MongoDB schema and a collection name that satisfies all the requirements that
the given schema does. Ensure that the schema is ready to be executed and created in the latest stable version of MongoDB.
Provide your reasoning as to why you recommended that particular MongoDB schema. You must provide
two reasons at the very list with a list of considerations. The first reason is embedding vs referencing in MongoDB and the
second is the indexing strategy. You may provide additional design considerations, but you must provide these two at the very least.
Return a JSON object with the provided structure.
Respond only with a valid JSON.
